# A Guide to Nepal Physics Olympiad

## About the book

A Guide to Nepal Physics Olympiad is a physics problem-solving guide for Nepali high school students, with special focus on Physics Olympiads. This is not to say that the book cannot be used for other purposes or by students of other nationalities. However, the main purpose of this book is to systematically guide Nepali high school students and prepare them for the Nepal Physics Olympiad (NePhO). The content of this book and the types of problems are organized as per the syllabus of NePhO.

## Motive of the book

Since 2007 when Nepal first participated in IPhO, we have bagged 3 bronze medals and 7 honorable mentions. It has long been our belief that a lack of preparatory materials and resources have led Nepali students to underachieve in IPhOs. We hope that this book will be a small step towards addressing this issue.

## About the authors

The authors - Laxman Bist, Nabin Kalauni and Sandesh Parajuli - finished in the top 3 of NePhO 2018 and represented Nepal in the International Physics Olympiad [(IPhO) 2018, Lisbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20230528142145/https://ipho2018.pt/content/delegations/nepal). Laxman Bist completed his B.S. in Physics with a minor in Neuroscience from Dartmouth College and is currently a recent trainee at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Nabin Kalauni completed his B.E. in Civil Engineering from IOE Pulchowk Campus and is currently working as a research assistant at Center for Water Resource Studies, IOE. Sandesh Parajuli completed his B.E. in Aerospace Engineering from IOE Pulchowk Campus.

## Call for contribution

We started this book immediately after our Olympiad experience in 2018. However, as we joined college and our own academics took precendece, we could not fully devote our time and resources towards the book. As a result, we have not been able to cover all the topics we had set out to cover. Hence, we would like to request any and all physics enthusiasts to contribute towards extending this book and making it more complete.

## How to contribute?

This book has been written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and published via Github, hence a working knowledge of TeX and git is expected. The best way to contribute to this repository is by following these steps:

- Fork this repository.
- Make changes in a separate branch.
- Create a pull request with adequate description of changes.

For interested contributors who are not familiar with these terms, the QGIS-documentation repo explains these steps in detail for people making their [first contribution](https://github.com/gitty-coder/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/docs/documentation_guidelines/first_contribution.rst).
