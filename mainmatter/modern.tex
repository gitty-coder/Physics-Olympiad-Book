\section{Key Concepts and Formulae}
\subsection{Relativity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Proper Length:} It is the length of the body along the moving direction measured by an observer in his frame of reference.
\item \textbf{Proper Time:} It the time measured by an observer in his frame of reference by using his own clock.
\item Lorentz factor ($\gamma$) is given by
\begin{align}
    {\gamma} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}     \label{eq1}
\end{align}
\item Total energy of a relativistic particle is related as:
\begin{align}
E^2  =  P^2C^2  +  {M_o}^2C^4      \label{eq2}
\end{align}
\item Momentum of relativistic particle,
\begin{align}
P = {\gamma}{M_o}v      \label{eq3}
\end{align}
\item Generally, we use K-frame or S-frame to denote inertial frame or laboratory frame where the body is at rest and k'-frame or S'-frame to denote the moving one.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item De Broglie wavelength: $\lambda$ = $\dfrac{2 \pi \hbar}{p}$, where p is the momentum of the particle. 
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Relations}: 
    \begin{align}
        \text{position- linear momentum }\Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar \\
        \text{Energy-time }\Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar\\
        \text{angular momentum - angle }\Delta L \Delta \theta \geq \hbar
    \end{align}
    \item \textbf{Schrodinger's wave equation:}\\
    one-dimensional time dependent equation: 
    \begin{align} 
        i\hbar\dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \dfrac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\dfrac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + U \Psi
    \end{align}
    one-dimensional time independent equation: 
    \begin{align}
        \dfrac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \dfrac{2m}{\hbar ^2}(E- U)\psi = 0
    \end{align}
    Here $\Psi$ is a time dependent wave function generally represented as $\Psi(x,t)$ in 1-D. And $\psi$ is time-independent or coordinate part of $\Psi (x, t)$. 
    
    \item Free particle: When U(x) = 0, we generally call it free. In such case, the Schrodinger's equation becomes: 
    \begin{align*}
        \psi(x) = Ae^{ikx}E = \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}
    \end{align*}
    \item Particle in a Box: If there is a non-zero potential wall, we call it a box.  
\end{enumerate}
\section{Bridging Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A Russian physicist P.A. Cerenkov discovered that a charged particle travelling in a solid at the speed of light in that material radiates electromagnetic radiation. What is the minimum kinetic energy in eV that an electron must have while travelling inside a slab of crown glass of refractive index 1.52 in order to create Cerenkov radiation? \hfill \textsl{(NePhO, UP)}

\textsc{Solution:}\\
For an electron of mass ‘m’ and charge ‘e’,\\
Inside the slab, the velocity of light can be calculated as,
\begin{align*}
v = \frac{c}{\mu}
\end{align*}
Then Kinetic Energy is given by,
\begin{align*}
    K.E.&= \left(\mu-1\right)mc^2\\
    &= \left(\ddfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}-1\right)mc^2 \hspace{1cm} \text{Using \eqref{eq1}}
\end{align*}
Solving we get,
\[
K.E._{min}= 0.168 MeV
\]

\item A particle of mass m moves in a one-dimensional potential
\[
V(x) = A\mathopen|x\mathclose|,\hspace{1cm} \text{where A is a positive constant.}
\]
Use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to estimate the minimum total energy of the particle as a function of m, A, and $\hbar$.\hfill \textsl{(NePhO)}
\\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
One-dimensional potential is given by,
\begin{align*}
V(x) &= A\mathopen|x\mathclose|      \label{eq4}\\
\text{Total Energy(T.E.)} &= \text{K.E. + P.E.}\\
&= \dfrac{p^2}{2m} + mA\mathopen|x\mathclose|
\end{align*}
from uncertainty principle, $\Delta$p $\times \Delta$x $\geq$ $\frac{\hbar}{2\pi}$\\
\begin{align*}
    \text{hence, P } &= \frac{\hbar}{2\pi x} \text{and, }\\
    E &= \frac{\hbar^2}{8m\pi^2x^2} +  mAx 
\end{align*}
For 'E' to be minimum, 
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{dE}{dx} &= 0\\
    \text{or, }mA &=  \frac{\hbar^2}{4m\pi^2x^3}\\
    \text{or, }x &= \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{4m^2A\pi^2}\right)^\frac{1}{3}\\
\end{align*}
Hence, \\
\[E_{min} = \]

\item The smallest length scale one can resolve is called the Planck Length $L_p$, which can be estimated in the following way. To get information within the length scale $L$, one needs a photon with the wavelength $\lambda$ roughly the same as the length scale. But any photon creates a (tiny) blackhole within which no information can get out. When the photon wavelength is equal 2 times the radius of the blackhole ($=L_p$), then we obtain the smallest length scale $L_p$. Note that a photon with wavelength $\lambda$ has energy $E = hc/\lambda$ and effective mass $m = E/c^2$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the Planck length.
    \item Determine the Planck energy $E_p$ which is the energy of a photon with its wavelength equal to $2\pi$ times the Planck length, in terms of electron volts(eV). You may find the constant hc = 1240eV.nm useful. 
\end{enumerate}
\hfill \textsl{(HKPhO)}\\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
a) \\
From given information, we know, \\
\begin{align}
    \lambda_p &= 2\pi L_p \\
    m &= \frac{E}{c^2}
\end{align}
Schwarzschild's radius in this case is: 
\begin{align}
    L_p  &= \frac{2Gm}{c^2}\\
    \text{and, }E &= \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\end{align}
Using above relations, we get: \\
\begin{align*}
    \frac{hc}{E}  &=  2\pi L_p \\
    \text{or, }\frac{hc}{mc^2}   &=   2\pi L_p\\
    \text{or, }\frac{2Gh}{c^3}  &=  2\pi L^2_p\\
    \therefore L_p &= \sqrt{\frac{Gh}{c^3\pi}}
\end{align*}
b) \\
\begin{align*}
    E_p &= \frac{hc}{\lambda_p}\\
    E_p &= \frac{hc}{2\pi L_p}
\end{align*}
Substituting 'L$_p$' from (a), we get:
\begin{align*}
    E_p &= \sqrt{\dfrac{hc^5}{4\pi G}}\hspace{2cm}Q.E.D.
\end{align*}
\item Consider a hydrogen atom of an electron bound to a proton. The system of electron and proton has, kinetic energy, $K = \ddfrac{P^2}{2m}$ , potential energy $U = -\ddfrac{ke^2}{r}$ , and total energy $E = K + U$. Treat the atom as a one dimensional system. The system will be stable when its total energy is minimum. By minimizing the total energy, estimate the radius of the atom and resulting total energy. \\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
\begin{align*}
    E = \dfrac{p^2}{2m} - \dfrac{ke^2}{r}
\end{align*}
Also, p $\sim \Delta$p and r $\sim \Delta$r\\
By Uncertainty Principle, $\Delta$p$\Delta$r $\sim \hbar$
\begin{align*}
    E &= \dfrac{p^2}{2m} - \dfrac{ke^2}{r}\\
    E &=  \frac{1}{2m}\dfrac{\hbar^2}{r^2}  - \frac{ke^2}{r}
\end{align*}
Fr E to be minimum, 
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{dE}{dr} &= 0\\
    \text{or, } \frac{ke^2}{r^2}   &= \dfrac{\hbar^2}{m r^3}\\
    \text{or, }r   &=   \frac{\hbar^2}{mke^2}
\end{align*}
Putting the value of ‘r’ we get,  \\
\[E_{min.}  =  -\dfrac{mk^2e^4}{2\hbar^2} \]
\\
\item A particle of rest mass $m_o$ and speed $v$ collides with a stationary particle of mass $M$ and sticks to it. What is the ﬁnal speed of the composite particle?\\

\textbf{Solution:}\\

Let M$_c$ be the mass of the composite particle and $\gamma_c$ be the factor, and ‘u’ be the speed. This is an inelastic collision where kinetic energy is not conserved. But be careful, the total energy and also the momentum are conserved.\\
By conservation of momentum, \\
\begin{align}
    \gamma m_o v  &= \gamma_c M_c u   
\end{align}
And, from conservation of total energy,
\begin{align}
    \gamma m_o c^2  +  Mc^2  &=  \gamma_c M_c c^2
\end{align}
from eqn 5.8 and 5.9, 
\begin{align*}
    \text{or, }\gamma m_o   +  M  &=  \frac{\gamma m_o v}{u}\\
    \therefore u &=  \frac{\gamma m_ov}{\gamma m_o + M}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\item When studying problems in special relativity it is often the invariant distance $\Delta s$ between two events that is most important, where $\Delta s$ is defined by
\begin{align}
(\Delta s)^2 = (c \Delta t)^2 - [(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2]   \label{eq5}

\]
Where $m_e$ is electron mass and other symbols have their usual meanings. For the hydrogen atom, express the radius of the $n^{\text{th}}$ Bohr orbit $r_n$ , energy level $E_n$, and the Rydberg constant R in terms of any two of \{A, B, C\} \hfill \textsl{(InPhO 2008)}
