\section{Key Concept and Formulae}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Gravitational Force (F) = G$\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ 
    
    \item Gravitational Potential (V) = -G$\dfrac{m}{r}$
    
    \item Gravitational Potential Energy (U) = -G$\dfrac{mm^{'}}{r}$
    
    \item It should be noted that gravitational potential (V) and gravitational Potential energy (U) are always negative in sign, their highest value being zero at infinity. This is clearly a consequence of the fact that in the case gravitation we come across only forces of attraction and hence never those of repulsion. 
    
    \item Orbital velocity (v$_o$) = $\sqrt{\dfrac{GM}{R}}$, where M is the mass of the planet and r is its radius.
    
    \item Escape velocity (v$_e$) = $\sqrt{\dfrac{2GM}{R}}$, where M is the mass of the planet and r is its radius.
    
    \item Velocity of the satellite and nature of the path: \\\\
    v = v$_o$ (circular path around the earth)\\
    v $<$ v$_o$ (elliptical path, return to the earth)\\
    v $>$ v$_o$ but $<$ v$_e$ (elliptical path, around the earth)\\
    v = v$_e$ (Parabolic path, escape from the earth)\\
    v $>$ v$_e$ (hyperbolic path, escape from earth)\\
